### Client

The `client` directory contains the front-end code of the application. It has the following subdirectories:

- `public`: This directory holds static files that are served by the client.
- `src`: This directory contains the main source code of the client application.
  - `assets`: This directory stores static assets such as images or fonts.
  - `components`: This directory contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
  - `scenes`: This directory contains the different scenes or pages of the application.
  - `state`: This directory includes state management-related files such as Redux reducers, actions, and store configuration.
  - `App.js`: The main entry point of the React application.
  - `index.css`: The global CSS file for styling the application.
  - `index.js`: The main JavaScript file responsible for rendering the React application.
  - `theme.js`: This file defines the theme and styling variables for the application.
- `jsconfig.json`: This file specifies the configuration options for the JavaScript language service used by the client code.
- `package-lock.json` and `package.json`: These files contain the dependencies and configuration details for the client-side packages used in the application.

### Server

The `server` directory contains the back-end code of the application. It has the following subdirectories:

- `controllers`: This directory holds the controllers responsible for handling the business logic of the application.
- `data`: This directory contains any data files required by the server.
- `models`: This directory includes the database models or schemas used by the server.
- `routes`: This directory defines the API routes and their associated handlers.
- `index.js`: The main entry point of the server application, responsible for setting up the server and connecting to the database.
- `package-lock.json` and `package.json`: These files contain the dependencies and configuration details for the server-side packages used in the application.

## Deployment

To deploy the Trade Tracker application, you can use a hosting platform like Render.com. Render.com provides a reliable platform for deploying web applications. You can follow their deployment instructions to deploy the client and server code separately.

Make sure to set up your MongoDB database and configure the necessary environment variables for the server application.
